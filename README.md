# Battle of the Banks

Battle of the Banks is the final project for 520.340 Intro to Mechatronics class in Fall 2017 at Johns Hopkins University with Professor Charbel Rizk. As a team of engineers, we build a robot with both defensive and offensive modes to protect the river bank from attack. We share our code, 3D design, and result here. 

## Mission
We are given a battleground with a river in the middle, splitting the two sides to offensive and defensive. In defensive mode, we need to be able draw or communicate SOS signal before the offensive team shoots us down. In offensive mode, we need to be able to shoot at the target (a small colored rectangular tag) before they finish the signal.  

## Approach
Since there are two modes, we want to build a 2-story robot that is easy to change between two modes. The bottom layer will be the defensive layer, with a marker to draw the SOS signal. The top layer will have an offensive system that can shoot ping pong ball at the target. The target detection will be from Pixy. We attached all the [3D printed parts](https://github.com/tannnguyen/Battle-of-the-Banks/tree/master/3dprint) and all the final version of our [code](https://github.com/tannnguyen/Battle-of-the-Banks/tree/master/code) that we made for this robot. 

Here is our final robot design:

## Result
For this competition, we finished 1st place with the fastest system for both offensive and defensive mode. You can view the videos of our robot in action within the [result](https://github.com/tannnguyen/Battle-of-the-Banks/tree/master/result) folder
